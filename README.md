This folder contains examples of R scripts that I used for data analyses and visualisation in published articles.

Each project has a subfolder with documents explaining background, aims, and code:   
* The html version is best downloaded and viewed locally to properly render the page    
* The rmd version can be downloaded and opened locally in R to edit the code, and run it with the example data in the repository
* If required
  *   example data files
  *   additional images for the html output, in a subfolder named projectFolderName_figs
