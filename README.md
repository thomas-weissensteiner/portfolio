This subfolders contain examples of R scripts that I used for data analyses and visualisation in published articles, and for a monthly visualisation challenge organised by the Visualisation Special Interest Group of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (VSI-PSI).

The enclosed documents include: 
* rmd files with executable code
* if required
  -   example data files
  -   a subfolder with additional images for the html output
* an html version (best downloaded and viewed locally)
* alternatively, rendered hmtl versions can be found at https://rpubs.com/thomas-weissensteiner/1261902
